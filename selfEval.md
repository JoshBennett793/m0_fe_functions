# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

	I'm most proud of writing technically sound documentation for the methods and function that I wrote. I'm not so used to speaking or writing so technically so it's been great practice.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

	Functions are such a powerful tool because of their reusability and scalability. They have the power to do anything you have the ingenuity to make them do. There are some beautifully written functions out there that I aspire to write in the future.
